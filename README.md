## Introduction

In the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), ensuring the robustness and reliability of models is crucial for their effective deployment in real-world applications. One key aspect of assessing the performance of NLP models is to evaluate their ability to handle errors and provide accurate results even in the presence of imperfect or noisy input data. More specifically we are lookig to see how NLP Models handle harware level bit errors. We are doing this by simulating errors wit three novel error injection methods. 

## Getting Started
